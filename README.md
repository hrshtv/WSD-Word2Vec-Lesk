<h2 align="center">WSD using the Lesk Algorithm with Word2Vec Embeddings</h2>

This is an unsupervised approach that uses pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings for computing the overlaps/similarities in the Lesk algorithm for WSD. It achieves an average F1-score of ?? on the [SemCor 3.0](https://www.kaggle.com/nltkdata/semcor-corpus) dataset.  

## Usage:
See [`code/main.ipynb`](code/main.ipynb) and run it cell by cell
