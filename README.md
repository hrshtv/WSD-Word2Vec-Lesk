<h2 align="center">WSD using the Lesk Algorithm with Word2Vec Embeddings</h2>

This is an unsupervised approach for [WSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation) that uses pre-trained [Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) embeddings for computing the overlaps/similarities in the [Lesk algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesk_algorithm). It's evaluated on the [SemCor 3.0](https://www.kaggle.com/nltkdata/semcor-corpus) dataset.  

## Usage:
See [`code/main.ipynb`](code/main.ipynb) and run it cell by cell
